                    <h1>The IDL Astronomy User's Library</h1>
                    <big>The IDL Astronomy Users Library is a central
                      repository for low-level astronomy software
                      written in the commercial language <a
                        href="http://www.harrisgeospatial.com/ProductsandTechnology/Software/IDL.aspx"> IDL.
                      </a> The Library is not meant to be an integrated
                      package, but rather is a
                      collection of procedures from which users can pick
                      and choose (and possibly
                      modify) for their own use. Submitted procedures
                      are given a cursory testing,
                      but are basically stored in the Library as
                      submitted. Instrument-specific software is
                      generally not
                      included in the IDL Astronomy Library, but can be
                      found at the <a href="other_url.html"> Links to
                        Other Astronomy and IDL related sites</a>.
                    </big>
                    <p><big>
                        The entire contents of the Library can be
                        downloaded in a tar file or in a .zip file
                        from the
                        the <a href="ftp"> download site </a>.
                        Additional
                        software, not included in the tar files, is
                        available in a <a href="ftp/contrib">
                          contrib </a> directory.
                        Individual procedures can be copied by browsing
                        through a list of <a href="contents.html">
                          one-line descriptions. </a> Changes to the
                        contents of the Library are
                        recorded in a <a href="news.html"> news
                        </a> file.    A versioned copy of the library is
			available on <a href="https://github.com/wlandsman/IDLAstro">
		            GitHub</a>, and one can also be download the Library with the command 
		            <br>
		            <i> git clone git://github.com/wlandsman/IDLAstro.git </i>
                      </big></p>

                         Some routines in the IDL Astronomy
                        Library make use of programs in the
<a href="http://www.idlcoyote.com/documents/programs.php#COYOTE_LIBRARY_DOWNLOAD">Coyote
                          Graphics Library</a>, which must be downloaded
			  separately.   Alternatively, one can download
			  <a href="ftp/coyote_astron.tar.gz"> 
			  coyote_astron.tar.gz </a> which contains a
			  subset of the Coyote procedures needed for the
			  Astronomy library.   We also suggest downloading the 
<a href="http://www.physics.wisc.edu/~craigm/idl/fitting.html">MPFIT</a> curve
fitting routines developed by Craig Markwardt, although it is currently only
used by one Astronomy Library routine 
(<a href="http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/pro/astrom/solve_astro.pro">
SOLVE_ASTRO</a> ) .

                        Documentation is available describing the
                        various options for working with <a

                        The IDL Astronomy Library requires at least IDL
                        V6.4.
                        However, separate (frozen) versions of the
                        Library that work with earlier
                        versions of IDL are available at the <a
                          href="ftp/old"> /old </a> download site. </big></p>
                    <p><big> The success of the IDL Astronomy User's
                        Library depends on the willingness
                        of users to give as well as take. Please inform
                        Wayne Landsman of any
                        possible contributions to the Library,
                        programming bugs or documentation
                        errors, or of relevant web sites. </big></p>
